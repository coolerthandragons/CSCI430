        <img src="../public/images/logo.png" alt="code-pen logo spelling out Rachel in Binary" class = "center">
        <p>Rachel Cubbage grew up in a small town in Stanley, Virginia. From a young age, she always had a book in her hand and enjoyed reading as much as she could. As she grew older, she began being interested in writing fantasy, horror, and general fiction since all of these genres were what she enjoyed reading. She has been to Paris, France, London, England, and hopes to travel more around the world.</p>

        <p>Currently, she is at Bridgewater College double majoring in Professional Writing and Computer Science. She plans to graduate by 2023. She graduated from Lord Fairfax Community College in 2019 with an Associateâ€™s Degree specialized in English before she graduated from high school.</p>
